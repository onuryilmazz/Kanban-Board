## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser.

### Running the Application

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Using the Gemini API

To enable AI-powered board generation and fun facts, you need a Gemini API key.

1.  Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Set the `API_KEY` environment variable in your local development environment. The application is configured to read this key.

> **Note**: When the API key is not available (e.g., when running directly from the filesystem or on a static host like GitHub Pages), the application will gracefully fall back to using sample data.
